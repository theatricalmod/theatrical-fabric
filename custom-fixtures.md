# Custom Fixtures
The mod does not contain hard-coded fixture blocks. They are dynamically registered from JSON files that contain information about fixtures.
<br>
If you are playing with the mod on a server that also has the mod, you must receive a hash that matches that of the server for the JSON pack or download one from the server. (TBC)
